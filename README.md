# kitty-kats scrapper

I got sick of download speed limit on keep2share when I try to pirate MetArt Album from kitty-kats website. This python script scrape hd image one by one from redirected hosted sites of "imagetwist.com", "imgspice.com" and "turbofile". The download folder is in "~/Pictures/.metart/".

updated >> You don't need to paste anymore. The script will automatically get url from your clipboard. The downloading time depends on the connection speed. If an image is less than 5mb, the whole album would take less than 20 minutes. I can't make parallel download since I haven't learnt about multi-threading. But when you open multiple terminal sessions and download multiple albums at the same time, They all finish in less than 30 mins. So, multi-threading is not necessary yet.

She is the reason I started this project since I can't satisfy with preview images from pornpics. It is sad that she only did one project in her life. Maybe she was doing good and didn't need to invest in side-hustle anymore. Or maybe she got married and lived a happy life. I wish she is doing well.
